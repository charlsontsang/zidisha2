    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>No middleman</h3>
      <p>First-generation microloan websites use local intermediary lenders. We connect lenders and borrowers directly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Lower cost for borrowers</h3>
      <p>Traditional microloans cost borrowers 40% interest or more. We eliminate intermediaries so borrowers keep more of their earnings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Direct communication</h3>
      <p>Borrowers post their own loan proposals, answer your questions and share photos and updates with you directly.</p>
