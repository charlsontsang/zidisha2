Hi there!
<br/><br/>
I’m Julia, the director of Zidisha.  I can’t tell you how thrilled and honored I am that you joined us.
<br/><br/>
Zidisha is different from other microlending websites.  We bypass local banks, so that the entrepreneurs don’t have to pay high administrative charges for your loans.  And since our entrepreneurs are web users too, you can communicate with them directly through their loan profile pages.  Give it a try!
<br/><br/>
To get started, go to the <a href={{ route('lend:index') }}>Lend</a> page and start exploring!  You can browse by country and business
type until
you
find an entrepreneur you’d like to connect with.
<br/><br/>
Zidisha is staffed by an amazing team of volunteers.  Don’t hesitate to ask us for help at any time.  You can reach us at Facebook, Twitter or by email to service@zidisha.org.
<br/><br/>
Can’t wait to change the world with you,
<br/><br/>
Julia Kurnia
<br/><br/>
