		'<p>Everyone who serves as a Volunteer Mentor must uphold these standards:</p>	 
		<p>1. Treat every applicant and member with courtesy and respect, without discriminating on the basis of repayment status, location, ethnicity, gender, religion or any other reason.</p>	 
		<p>2. Do not accept any payment from Zidisha members or applicants.</p>
		<p>3. Strive to prevent abuse of our lending platform through energetic pursuit of willful defaulters. At the same time, treat all clients regardless of repayment status with courtesy and respect, and not deprive them of their basic means of livelihood in order to repay a loan.
		Acceptable repayment collection practices include reminders, mediation involving local community leaders, and judicial process.
		Unacceptable repayment collection practices include abusive language, threats, harassment of borrowers at their place of work or worship, forcible entry to borrowers\' homes, and seizing property without court order or in violation of the law.</p>	 
		<p>4. Protect your assigned members\' privacy.  Do not share or post their personal contact information on the internet, and only communicate information the member wishes to share in your public comments on the Zidisha website.</p>
		<p>5. Keep comments posted on loan profile pages truthful, but professional and positive.  Do not post any negative comments or accusations that could unfairly damage the member\'s reputation.</p>	 
		<p>6. Take action to protect the integrity of our community.  Should a violation of any of these standards come to your attention, please email details of the violation to service@zidisha.org.</p>',

	'vm-faq-title'		=> 'Volunteer Mentor Frequently Asked Questions',
	'vm-faq-content'		=> 
		'<h4>Is this a paid position? Does Zidisha reimburse the costs I incur?</h4>
		<p>No. Being a VM is an unpaid position, and Zidisha cannot reimburse costs.  We do provide VMs with access to the organization\'s Skype account so that you need not pay for phone calls, but you must be able to cover the internet costs yourself.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Can I serve as VM only for members I have personally invited or who live in my area?</h4>
		<p>No. A requirement of the VM program is to assist all members in your country who are assigned to you.  If you wish to assist only specific members, you are welcome to do this without serving as a VM.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Will I need to physically visit my assigned members?</h4>	
		<p>No. You may visit your assigned members if you wish, but due to the time and expense that may be involved, this is not a requirement.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>How many members will I be responsible for?</h4>
		<p>The maximum number of assigned members our website allows is 50.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>How are members assigned to me?</h4>
		<p>When you first join as a VM, we may assign a few members who are currently in arrears to you so that you can help them. After that, new members are assigned as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you have less than 50 members assigned, new members will have the option to choose you as their VM.</li>
			<li>First, your town or city will appear in a menu in the new member registration form, and the new member will be asked to choose the town closest to them from that menu. This is intended to make it more likely that new members will be assigned to VMs close to them.</li>
			<li>Next, the member will be asked to choose a VM from all of the available VMs located in the town they chose. If the member chooses you, you will be assigned as their VM.</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<h4>Why does my location or name not appear in the borrower registration form?</h4>
		<p>Your name will only appear if you have fewer than 50 members assigned to you.  This is to ensure that the number of members assigned to each VM remains manageable.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>How will my contact information be shared?</h4>
		<p>Your name, telephone number and email address will be displayed in the profile page of the members who choose you as their VM.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>How can I access Zidisha\'s Skype account?</h4>
		<p>Please use our Skype account only to call Zidisha members in arrears or their contacts, and take care not to share the password with anyone else. Each person\'s use is monitored and each call costs the organization money, so please use this resource in moderation.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to <a href="www.skype.com">www.skype.com</a> to install Skype on your computer or smart phone, if it is not already installed.</li>
			<li>Log in with username zidisha.inc.  If you do not already have the password, send an email to service@zidisha.org to request it.</li>
			<li>Open the "Window" menu at the top of the Skype screen, and select "Dial Pad".</li>
			<li>Select your country, then enter the desired telephone number without the country code and without any zeros before the number.</li>  
			<li>Click "Call" to make a voice call to that number, and click "SMS" to send a text message.</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<h4>One of my assigned members cannot log in to his or her account. How can I help?</h4>
		<p>If the member still has access to the email account used to register with Zidisha, use the "Forgot password" link in the login page to reset the password. Otherwise, you may send an email to service@zidisha.org to and ask us to send a new password to the member\'s mobile phone number. You can then log in using the member\'s email address and the password we sent.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>How can I qualify for a VM credit limit bonus?</h4>
		<p>As long as you remain a VM and fulfill the <a href="index.php?p=131">VM program requirements</a>, you will receive a credit limit bonus for each of your assigned members who remains current with scheduled repayments. You may view the specific bonus amounts for your country in the Current Credit Limit page of your account.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Can I opt out of being a VM?</h4>
		<p>Yes, being a VM is strictly voluntary.  If at any time you feel you can no longer perform VM duties, please do not hesitate to contact us at service@zidisha.org and ask to close your VM account.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Can I recommend others for a VM position?</h4>
		<p>Yes.  If you know anyone that is a good fit, please have them email us at service@zidisha.org.</p>
