  ['Farming Inputs', 'Farmers transform inputs like seeds, fertilizer
and pesticides into nutritious grains, fruits, vegetables and more. ', 'The quantity and quality of crops depends a great deal on the inputs
used. Improved seed varieties, in combination with appropriate amounts
of fertilizer, can increase yields several-fold and result in more
nutritient-rich crop varieties.  Small-scale farmers typically use a
portion of their crops to feed their own families and sell the remainder
to the neighboring community.', 'Many farmers are forced to acquire
inputs such as seeds and fertilizer from local moneylenders at
exorbitant cost - leaving them with little or no profits after selling
the crops to repay the moneylenders. Your loan can break this cycle of
debt by providing financing for inputs at reasonable rates.', false],
    ['Livestock', 'Animals like chickens, fish, goats and cows are
purchased when they are young, and raised with a great deal of attention
and care until they begin producing value such as eggs, milk or meat. Or
they are allowed to breed, yielding a several-fold return on the cost of
their purchase.', 'Many families choose to invest their savings in
livestock, because the livestock generate a continuous stream of revenue
in the form of eggs, milk and young that can be sold. Livestock raising
is also a good tool for gradually increasing ones wealth. Small
animals like chickens and rabbits can be purchased for just a few
dollars, and can be raised and bred to multiply their value within a few
months. The resulting earnings can be invested in more valuable
livestock such as goats, pigs and even dairy cows. ', 'Your loan allows
an entrepreneur to make a larger investment up front, purchasing a
greater quantity or higher-value animal than he or she could afford with
savings alone. This allows the entrepreneur to generate substantial
earnings quickly, rather than wait years to gradually build up the value
of his or her livestock.', 't'],
    ['3', 'Restaurant', 'An entrepreneur with a talent for cooking or
hospitality transforms ingredients like fruits, vegetables, grain and
spices into delicious drinks, snacks and meals. Customers are served at
indoor restaurants, wooden stalls alongside roads, or even at the
entrepreneurs home.', 'Many entrepreneurs get their start in
restaurant businesses, because the upfront cost is very low: a street
seller can acquire a days worth of ingredients for less than a dollar.
Cooking also offers a great deal of scope for artistic creativity, as
those most passionate about crafting tasty meals and pleasant dining
experiences are rewarded with an ever-increasing flow of customers.', 'Loans can allow an entrepreneur who sells food on the street to rent or
purchase a more comfortable indoor restaurant location, or to add more
chairs and tables to an existing restaurant. These investments allow a
larger number of customers to be served at a time, multiplying the
restaurants revenue-generating capacity.', 't'],
    ['Food Retail', 'An entrepreneur purchases food items like grain,
flour, meat and garden produce from farmers or wholesalers, and sells
them to individual households, usually from small shops or market
stalls.', 'A startlingly high proportion of food produced in developing
countries spoils before it can be consumed, because of difficulties in
distributing it to the households that want to purchase it. Food
retailers help solve this problem by connecting producers of food with
consumers, ensuring that farmers can sell what they produce and families
can purchase it at a location and in quantities accessible to them. The
presence of a food retailer improves nutrition for an entire community,
by increasing the variety of food items available locally and reducing
its price through greater supply.', 'It is hard for food retailers to
accumulate large sums of money, because they sell in small quantities
and frequently allow low-income families to defer payment for food. A
loan can provide the large sums they need to stock new varieties of food
and to purchase inventory at wholesale prices, reducing the cost to the
consumer while improving profit margins.', false],
    ['Clothing Retail - New', 'Local tailors purchase cloth and turn it
into traditional or Western-style clothing. The clothing can be made
"ready to wear," or it can be tailored and designed to fit the
individual who orders it.', 'Clothing production is especially well
suited to creating employment because it is labor-intensive. Successful
clothing producers grow their businesses by employing others and having
each employee specialize in one aspect of the production process.', 'The
production capacity of a clothing business is limited by two main
factors: the owners ability to acquire material in bulk, and the
number of sewing machines owned. An additional sewing machine and supply
of cloth can allow the business to take on another full-time employee -
creating a new job while boosting production and revenue.', 't'],
    ['Beauty', 'Entrepreneurs with a gift for making others look and feel
beautiful offer their services open a barbershop or beauty salon, or
they supply beauty-enhancing products like perfumes and cosmetics.', 'Though it is expressed differently from one culture to another, the
quest to enhance one\'s personal beauty is universal. Entrepreneurs in
the beauty business use their artistic talent to uplift others, bringing
much-needed brightness to lighten the burden of hard lives.', 'Beauty
businesses often serve large numbers of customers at low margins, making
it difficult to accumulate revenue in bulk. A loan can provide the bulk
amount needed to improve a beauty facility by painting and adding
furniture, or to acquire equipment like hairdryers and haircutting
machines. ', false],
    ['Education', 'Education workers provide goods and services to
schools - or even start their own schools, offering education from the
preschool to the professional training level.', 'Universal access to
quality education is still a distant dream in most developing countries.
Government-provided schools are often too far away, too expensive, or of
poor quality. Social entrepreneurs step in to fill the gap, opening
affordable academies for children of low-income communities, and
offering training that allows young adults to qualify for higher-paying
professional jobs.', 'Small-scale business owners typically serve
low-income students at discounted tuition rates. This allows them to
cover their costs, but makes it difficult to accumulate enough revenue
to reinvest in growing the business. Loans make it possible to add
classrooms, teachers, computers and other educational equipment,
increasing the capacity of the school, so that larger numbers of
students can be connected to education sooner.', 't'],
    ['Transportation', 'Vehicles like motorbikes, taxis and shared vans
provide affordable public transport within and between towns.', 'Residents of developing countries often rely on public transport to
commute to work, transport goods to market and visit family. By
facilitating movement of goods and connecting residents with outside
employment opportunities, a new public transport service can boost the
economy of an entire village or neighborhood.', 'Many young adults get
their start in the transportation business by working as wage laborers,
driving motorbike taxis owned by others. They can use a small loan to
purchase their own motorbike taxi, allowing them to become their own
boss and keep the full days earnings from the vehicle. Larger loans
can be used to acquire additional motorbikes or to progress to larger
vehicles like car taxis and vans for transport between cities, creating
employment for others while growing their own income.', false],
    ['Health', 'Local retailers supply clinics with consumables like
medicines, painkillers, syringes and disinfectants.', 'The bulk of
health care in developing countries is provided by small neighborhood
clinics, which offer affordable or even donated treatment of common
ailments. Small-scale traders connect these clinics with much-needed
supplies, but there are not enough of them, and the clinics frequently
run out - forcing patients to do without or seek treatment elsewhere.
The presence of these supplies can determine whether a patient can be
vaccinated with a safe unused syringe, a victim of a traffic accident
can be administered a painkiller, or a child ill with malaria receives
timely medication.', 'Clinics often treat patients regardless of ability
to pay. As a result, they are frequently short of cash, and this
undermines their ability to purchase large supplies of medical
consumables at wholesale prices.  Whether you support a clinic or a
health product supplier, your loan can alleviate suffering and even save
lives.', false],
    ['Cybercafe', 'A cybercafe can be as simple as a tiny room with a
second-hand desktop, or it can be a larger facility with several
computers, printers and videoconferencing equipment. The computers are
connected to the internet by cable, or via USB keys that pick up data
signals from local mobile phone networks. Browsing sessions are offered
in timeslots, with the cheapest costing just a few cents.', 'Internet
use is spreading rapidly in developing countries, especially among young
adults in urban areas, who go online to study, search for jobs, and
connect with friends and family. Most people do have home computers, and
depend on public cybercafes to access the internet. In places where
books have always been scarce, the internet connects motivated
individuals with a world of knowledge and opportunity that transcends
their physical location.', 'Cybercafe customers must often wait a long
time for an available computer. A loan can allow a cybercafe owner to
add one or more computers, doubling or tripling capacity. ', 't'],
    ['Mobile Phone', 'Retailers offer prepaid mobile phone cards,
accessories and even handsets from streetside kiosks and shops.', 'Mobile phones have revolutionized life in developing countries, as
households that never had access to electricity or landline phones use
mobile phones for everything from comparing the prices of farm produce
in neighboring markets to receiving remittances from family overseas. By
enabling communication in places without much public infrastructure,
mobile phones smooth fluctuations in food prices and make it easier to
hold political leaders accountable. ', 'Larger amounts of capital make
it possible for mobile phone retailers to upgrade their inventory,
offering affordable smart phones for the first time. Or they can offer
services such as prepaid data subscriptions and even mobile phone-based
money transfers.', 't'],
    ['Entertainment', 'From local theater to homemade DVD cinemas, these
businesses provide hours of enjoyment at prices everyone can afford.', 'Large-scale entertainment services like movie theaters, concert halls
and nightclubs are out of reach for many people in developing countries.
Local entrepreneurs make their own entertainment, combining simple
equipment with sheer ingenuity to enliven their communities with beauty
and fun.', 'Many entertainment services rely on expensive imported
equipment, such as DVD players and microphones. Loans can finance these
purchases up front, giving aspiring entertainers the chance to prove
themselves.', false],
    ['Household Supplies', 'Retailers purchase supplies of goods like
furniture, cooking fuel, soap and utensils, and market them to homes via
door-to-door sales or neighborhood shops.', 'Local suppliers of
household goods can enhance the quality of life of an entire community
by distributing products that save labor and make homes comfortable at
affordable prices. ', 'Small-scale household supply retailers often
store inventories in their homes, limiting the volume that can be stored
and making it difficult to delegate sales to employees. Loans can be
used to acquire dedicated facilities to store and process household
goods, allowing the business to grow without compromising the owners
home life.', 't'],
    ['Professional Services', 'These entrepreneurs are freelance
knowledge workers, offering services like blogging, data transcription
and website localization to clients both domestic and overseas.', 'Service businesses are common in wealthy economies, but are still
exceptional in developing countries.  Service businesses do not consume
raw materials or produce pollution. They are a fulfilling career choice
because their value depends on ones unique mix of knowledge, talent
and experience. ', 'A loan can allow an entry-level freelance
professional to acquire productivity-enhancing equipment, such as a
personal computer or high-speed internet connection - allowing him or
her to spend more time producing value and less time commuting or
waiting in line at cybercafes.', false],
    ['Outside the Box', 'Businesses too unique to have their own
categories are listed here.', 'These entrepreneurs are often the most
creative, operating businesses that have little in common with others at
Zidisha. They not only produce valuable goods and services, but also add
fresh ideas and variety to their markets.', 'Entrepreneurs with
unconventional business models tend to have an especially hard time
raising funding to finance their ambitions. A loan can give them the
chance to overturn the status quo, producing innovation that paves the
way for other entrepreneurs in their communities.', false],
    ['Farming Equipment', 'Farmers use equipment to make land that would
normally be barren produce crops. For example, hard earth can be made
cultivable with a tractor and plow, and dry land can produce food crops
when irrigated.', 'Equipment like irrigation pumps, drip irrigation
tubes, tractors and plows increase crop yield dramatically, while
allowing farmers to cultivate crops during more seasons of the year.
This allows farmers to produce more food without needing to acquire more
land.', 'Farm equipment often costs more than smallholder farmers earn
in many months, making it difficult to finance its purchase with
savings. Your loan makes it possible to acquire the equipment first,
then pay for it with the increased earnings that result.', false],
    ['Clothing Retail - Used', 'Second-hand clothing from America or
Europe - much of it donated through charities like Goodwill - is packed
up in bales and sent to developing countries. Local entrepreneurs then
purchase the used clothing and sell it at affordable prices in market
stalls and shops.', 'New clothing of the type worn in America or Europe
is too expensive for most residents of developing countries to afford.
The import and sale of used clothing creates a viable substitute, makes
it possible for local residents to acquire a wide range of clothing,
shoes and even office wear at accessible prices.', 'A small loan can
allow a clothing retailer to purchase inventory in bulk, increasing
profit margins while improving choice and cost for customers. A larger
loan can make it possible for a retailer who has been selling clothing
outdoors to move into a shop, improving the shelf life of the clothing
and the quality of life of the entrepreneur.', false],
